#A blog platform created using flask microframework.

####Why another blog platform? 

The main intention is to learn web programming. A blog has all the common components you would typically encounter in web development like database management, pagination, administrator interface and safe handling of user input.

####Hosting

This blog will be hosted on Google's appenigne platform. As such I have used the appengine API for Admin login and will also use it for the OpenID login for the user comments (under development).

####Flask Extensions
Flask-Markdown for Markdown support.
Flask_WTForms for inputs.
Google Datastore API for database access.
